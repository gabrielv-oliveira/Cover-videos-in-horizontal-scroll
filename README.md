## Description

This is a simple example of a horizontal video gallery with an overlay effect, implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project aims to showcase a collection of videos with preview thumbnails. When the play icon is clicked, the video starts playing in an overlay on top of the page content. Additionally, a darkening effect is applied to the thumbnail when hovering over it.

The horizontal scroll feature allows users to navigate through the various videos available in the gallery. When a video is clicked, it starts playing, and the overlay disappears, providing users with a full-screen video experience.
